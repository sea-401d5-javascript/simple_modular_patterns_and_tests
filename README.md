  * fork this repository
  * write all of your code in a folder containing your name
  * push to your repository
  * submit a pull request to this repository
  * submit a link to your PR in canvas

##Description:
This assignment will have you create a simple Javascript object that will be exported using the Node modular pattern we went over in class.
Your object should have a function named 'greet' that takes a name as a parameter and returns the string 'hello ' + name

You should have at least one test that verifies the output of the function.

Your submission should be a link to your pull request.

##Bonus:
For an extra point, create a command line utility that will be run using node greet.js 'some name' and will pass the input contained in that argument to the greet function and output the result to the screen.

For a second bonus point, write a test that makes sure that the arguments are being processed.
